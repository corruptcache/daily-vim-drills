DAY 4 VIM WORKOUT: NEOVIM & STRUCTURAL FLOW (25 MIN)

==============================================================================

INSTRUCTIONS:

Open this file: nvim day4.txt

Perform the tasks in order.

No arrow keys.

If a command doesn't work, check your LazyVim keybinds with :Telescope keymaps.

SECTION 1: THE JUMP LIST & CHANGELIST (5 MIN)

Goal: Move back and forth through your editing history.

DRILL A: The Jump List
Instruction:

Press 'G' to jump to the bottom of the file.

Press 'gg' to jump back to the top.

Press 'Ctrl + o' (Old) to jump back to where you just were (the bottom).

Press 'Ctrl + i' to jump forward again in your jump history.

DRILL B: The Change List
Instruction:

Go to DRILL A above and change 'Old' to 'Previous' using 'ciw', then <ESC>.

Move your cursor somewhere else entirely.

Press 'g;' (Go to semicolon) to jump back to the exact spot of your last change.

SECTION 2: ADVANCED VISUAL BLOCK (5 MIN)

Goal: Simultaneous editing across multiple lines.

DRILL A: Appending to a Block
Instruction:

Place cursor on the '1' in 'Item 1'.

Press 'Ctrl + v' and move down to select all 4 lines.

Press '$' to extend the selection to the end of the longest line.

Press 'A' (Shift+a) to append.

Type ' [PENDING]' and press <ESC>. (Wait a moment for it to sync).

Item 1
Item 2
Item 3
Item 4

SECTION 3: LINE TRANSPOSITION & COMFORT (5 MIN)

Goal: Move lines up and down (Commonly mapped in Neovim/LazyVim).

DRILL A: Moving Lines
Instruction:
In many Neovim setups (including LazyVim), you can move lines using Alt+j and Alt+k.

Put cursor on 'MOVE ME'.

Try 'Alt + j' to move the line down.

Try 'Alt + k' to move it up.

(Place cursor here)
MOVE ME
(Between these lines)

SECTION 4: MACRO REFINEMENT (5 MIN)

Goal: Editing a macro without re-recording it.

DRILL A: Pasting a Macro
Instruction:

Let's say you have a macro in register 'q'. Since you don't, record this:
'qq', 'I', 'STUB: ', <ESC>, 'q'.

Now, let's look at the macro. Go to an empty line and press '"qp'.

You should see the keystrokes. Change 'STUB' to 'DONE'.

Yank the new string back into the register: '0"qy$'.

Now run '@q' on the target below.

Target: Update this line using the edited macro.

SECTION 5: NEOVIM LSP & DIAGNOSTICS (5 MIN)

Goal: Navigating "Errors" (Simulated).

In a real code file, LazyVim uses ]d and [d to jump between errors.
Instruction:

If you were in a Lua or Python file, you would press ]d to find the next error.

Press 'K' while hovering over a word to see "Hover Documentation" (Simulated here).

Target Word: Function_Name()
(Pretend pressing 'K' here shows you the parameters of this function).
